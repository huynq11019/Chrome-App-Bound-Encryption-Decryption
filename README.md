A post-exploitation tool demonstrating a complete, in-memory bypass of Chromium's **App-Bound Encryption (ABE)**. This project leverages a fileless, multi-stage injection process utilizing direct syscalls and reflective DLL injection to decrypt and exfiltrate sensitive user data (cookies, passwords, payments) from modern Chromium browsers.

## üî¨ Technical Workflow

The tool operates via a two-stage process, meticulously designed to evade common endpoint defenses and achieve its objectives without requiring administrative privileges or leaving artifacts on disk.

### **Stage 1: The Injector (`chrome_inject.exe`)**

1.  **Initialization:** The injector starts by parsing command-line arguments and dynamically initializing a **direct syscall engine**. It enumerates `ntdll.dll`'s export table, sorts `Zw` functions by address to determine their Syscall Service Numbers (SSNs), and locates `syscall/ret` or `svc/ret` gadgets. This allows all subsequent process interactions to bypass user-land API hooking.
2.  **Payload Preparation:** The core payload DLL is not stored on disk. It is embedded as an encrypted resource within the injector. At runtime, the injector loads this resource, decrypts it in-memory using a **ChaCha20** cipher, and prepares it for injection.
3.  **Targeting & Injection:** It identifies the target browser process. Using the direct syscall engine, it allocates executable memory in the target (`NtAllocateVirtualMemory`), writes the decrypted payload (`NtWriteVirtualMemory`), and initiates execution via **Reflective DLL Injection (RDI)** by creating a new thread pointing to the `ReflectiveLoader` export (`NtCreateThreadEx`).

### **Stage 2: The Injected Payload (In-Memory)**

1.  **Bootstrapping:** Once in the target's memory space, the `ReflectiveLoader` stub acts as a custom PE loader. It properly maps the DLL's sections, resolves its import address table (IAT) by parsing PEB structures and hashing module/function names, and performs base relocations. Finally, it calls the payload's `DllMain`.
2.  **COM Hijack:** The payload, now running with the browser's own identity, connects back to the injector via a named pipe for C2. It then instantiates the browser's internal `IElevator` COM server. Because the call originates from a legitimate, path-validated process, the COM server's security checks are satisfied.
3.  **Master Key Decryption:** The payload invokes the `DecryptData` method on the COM interface, passing it the `app_bound_encrypted_key` from the `Local State` file. The COM server successfully decrypts it, returning the plaintext AES-256 master key to our payload.
4.  **Data Exfiltration:** With the master key, the payload discovers all user profiles, accesses the relevant SQLite databases (`Cookies`, `Login Data`, `Web Data`), and uses the key to decrypt sensitive data blobs with **AES-256-GCM**. The decrypted secrets are formatted as JSON and streamed back to the injector, which writes them to the output directory.

## üõ°Ô∏è Core Technical Pillars

This tool is built on several advanced, security-focused techniques:

*   **Direct Syscalls for Evasion:** Bypasses EDR/AV user-land hooks on standard WinAPI functions (`OpenProcess`, `WriteProcessMemory`, etc.) by invoking kernel functions directly. The engine is robust, supporting both x64 and ARM64 by finding syscall gadgets dynamically at runtime.

*   **Fileless In-Memory Payload:** The payload DLL never touches the disk on the target machine. It is stored encrypted in the injector, decrypted in-memory, and reflectively loaded, significantly reducing its signature and forensic footprint.

*   **Reflective DLL Injection (RDI):** A stealthy process injection method that avoids using `LoadLibrary`, thereby evading common detection mechanisms that monitor module loads. The loader is self-contained and resolves all dependencies from memory.

*   **Target-Context COM Invocation:** The critical step for defeating App-Bound Encryption. By executing code *within* the trusted browser process, we inherit its identity, allowing us to make legitimate-appearing calls to the ABE COM server and bypass its path-validation security checks.

    This article details the specific challenges and reverse engineering journey undertaken to achieve reliable ABE decryption for Microsoft Edge. It includes:
    *   An account of the initial issues and misleading error codes (`E_INVALIDARG`, `E_NOINTERFACE`).
    *   The process of using COM type library introspection (with Python `comtypes`) to uncover Edge's unique `IElevatorEdge` vtable structure and inheritance.
    *   How this insight led to tailored C++ interface stubs for successful interaction with Edge's ABE service.

    *   Explains the necessity for dynamic COM interface analysis due to browser variations and updates.
    *   Details COMrade ABE's methodology: registry scanning for service discovery, Type Library loading and parsing, and heuristic-based ABE method signature matching.
    *   Provides a comprehensive guide to interpreting COMrade ABE's output, including CLSIDs, IIDs (standard and C++ style), and the significance of verbose output details like VTable offsets, defining interfaces, and full inheritance chains.
    *   Highlights the utility of the auto-generated C++ stubs (`--output-cpp-stub`) for rapid development and research.
    *   Discusses how COMrade ABE aids in adapting to ABE changes, analyzing new Chromium browsers, and understanding vendor-specific COM customizations.

## üìÇ Data Extraction

Once decryption completes, data is saved to the specified output path (defaulting to `.\output\` if not specified via `--output-path`). Files are organized as follows:

**Base Path:** `YOUR_CHOSEN_PATH` (e.g., `.\output\` or the path you provide)
**Structure:** <Base Path>/<BrowserName>/<ProfileName>/<data_type>.txt

Example paths (assuming default output location):**

- üç™ **Cookies (Chrome Default profile):** .\output\Chrome\Default\cookies.txt
- üîë **Passwords (Edge Profile 1):** .\output\Edge\Profile 1\passwords.txt
- üí≥ **Payment Methods (Brave Default profile):** .\output\Brave\Default\payments.txt

    "name": "OSID",
    "value": "g.a000uwj5ufIS‚Ä¶"

```

### üîë Password Extraction

Each password file is a JSON array of objects:

```json
[
  {
    "origin": "https://example.com/login",
    "username": "user@example.com",
    "password": "‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢"
